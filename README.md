# The Evolutionary Simulator
### COMP3000 Final Year Computer Science Project

## About

### Overview
The Evolutionary Simulator is a simulator/game with the aim of simulating evolution in simple ecosystems with predator-prey relationships. Customisation allows users to change features such as a species genetics, mutatition rates and food scarcity prior to run-time to ensure that each simulation will act in a unique way. The visualisation of data enhances the experience by supplying an abundance of useful and interesting data related to the simulation. The simplistic UI and use of 3D models, animations and a hexagonal grid create an intuitive environment that is visually appealing and easy to understand.

### Procedural Generation
Procedural generation is used to create unique and random terrain each simulation. This feature will mean that no two simulations will ever be the same.

### Genetic Algorithms
A customised genetic algorithm is used to simulate inheritance and mutations of offpsring when two individuals reproduce. The fitness function is naturally simulated through the process of natural selection. 

### Artificially Intelligent Animals
Prey and predator species use custom made algorithms that mimic the decision making of animals in real life.  

### Graphical Data
The diverse range of statistics gives users a great understanding of the proccesses involved in evolution and what genetics are best for species.

### Customisation
Customisation enhances the experimentational abilities and gives the opportunity to attempt to create balanced ecosystems.
